*H*ello, this is not a typical blog, but an atypical one. My name is **William Gizzi**, I go by **Dan**, and I'm a musician, fitness-enthusiast, and science lover. I have a BS in *Biology* with minors in *Chemistry* and *Mathematics*. I lived on Pennsylvania Ave. for a few months. You can find me on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/wdgizzi), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/dangizzi),
[Instagram](http://instagram.com/dangizzi), [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/wdgizzi), [Beatstars](http://gizzibeats.beatstars.com/), and [Github](https://github.com/gizzidan) *(I know, I'm all over the place).* Shoot me an [email](mailto:gizzidan01@gmail.com) and make me happy.

## The Content
This blog is an extension of my mind. I'm not a very systematic or thematic blogger so be warned. I hope to provide interesting articles with topics including science, history, music, and health.

## SimplFit
Currently, I've been working hard on a fitness startup, [SimplFit](http://www.simplfit.com/), which I started with one of my long time friends. It is a competitive online marketplace virtually connecting fitness professionals with prospective clients.
