*M*ore. Revealed. Corruption. <span class="nice-italic">Mossack Fonseca</span>, a Panamanian law firm, sells anonymous offshore companies around the world. **2.6 TB** of internal data from Mossack Fonseca spanning from the 1970s to 2016 was leaked to [Süddeutsche Zeitung ](http://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/en/). These data reveal that many prominent and high-ranking individuals—over **140** politicians from more than **50** countries —may have been using these shell companies for tax evasion and other shady business dealings. Read all about [The Power Players in the Panama Papers](https://panamapapers.icij.org/the_power_players/). The amount of data to mine is impressive, and the 2.6 TB of data leaked greatly overshadows the 260 GB Offshore Leaks *(2013)* and 1.7 GB WikiLeaks *(2010)*. This frightening revelation makes one consider the magnitude of corruption hidden in the shadows.
