*M*ore. Revealed. Corruption. <span class="nice-italic">Mossack Fonseca</span>, a Panamanian law firm, sells anonymous offshore companies around the world. The discovery of approximately **2.6 TB** of internal data from Mossack Fonseca spanning from the 1970s to 2016 greatly overshadows the 260 GB Offshore Leaks *(2013)* and 1.7 GB WikiLeaks *(2010)*. This frightening revelation makes one consider the magnitude of corruption hidden in the shadows. [A guide to the biggest data leak in history.](http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-panama-papers).

## Who?
First, it should be noted that more research is needed to establish which— *and how many* —of those implicated are using the offshore companies for "bad" practices. [Here is an ELI5 on Reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4d8rta/eli5_the_panama_papers/d1owxn5)
